This repository is a companion of the Know the Code Testing Series for labs:

- [Unit & Integration Testing Basics](https://knowthecode.io/labs/unit-integration-testing-basics)

To install, do the following:

1. Make sure you've already set up your [Mac](https://knowthecode.io/labs/local-development-environment-setup-mac) or [Windows](https://knowthecode.io/labs/local-development-environment-setup-windows) machine with a Local Host (such as Local by Flywheel, VVV, or others), Git, SSH, and Composer.
2. Spin up a new local site on your machine.  I've called my testinglab.local.
3. Open your favorite command line tool.
4. Navigate to the `themes` directory in your local site, i.e. the one you created above.
5. Type: `git clone https://github.com/KnowTheCode/ktc-testing-series.git`.
